                <p>Kerala, a state in the southwest coastal area of India, is spread over 38,863 kilometres squares
                    kilometres. It is the 21st largest state in India in terms of area. Kerala has 14 districts that
                    are enriched with natural beauty. Though a small state, Kerala carries the Western Ghats,
                    farmlands planted with various trees, most significant of which is coconut, the rivers Ponnani
                    (Bharathapuzha), Periyar, Chalakudi, and Pamba that flow to the Arabian Sea and also comprise a
                    variety of flora and fauna as the land and hilly areas are covered with rainforests.

                    Kerala is the 8th largest economy in India which is growing at a faster pace. The IT,
                    industrial, and agricultural sectors in Kerala are flourishing. Tourism in Kerala is at an
                    all-time high because the environment offers different experiences with the changing
                    environment.
                    A large variety of flora and fauna are found in Kerala, including many mammals, birds, fishes,
                    reptiles, and amphibians. Some of the most renowned animals are the Indian elephant, Indian
                    Leopard, and Bengal tiger. The most notable trees among the thousands of diverse trees in the
                    forests of Kerala are Dalbergia latifolia, snorkelling, Cassia, mullu murikku, and Erythrina.
                    There are other plants also such as bamboo, wild cardamom, wild black pepper, the calamus rattan
                    palm, aromatic vetiver grass, etc.

                    The rich biodiversity is an attraction for tourism in Kerala as the most endangered species of
                    animals are found here. Every year thousands of people from all over the world gather in Kerala
                    to experience nature.
                    Kerala is among the top 50 must-visit destinations on the Earth. This is due to beaches,
                    backwaters, lakes, mountain ranges, waterfalls, ancient ports, palaces, religious institutions,
                    and wildlife sanctuaries which are major attractions for both domestic and international
                    tourists. The stateâ€™s ecotourism programme includes mountaineering, trekking, and bird-watching.
                    The city of Kochi ranks first as the most visited tourist place in Kerala. The best time for
                    touring Kerala is around December- February. Kerala tourism expenses are one of the cheapest in
                    India.

                    The capital of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, is an industrial hub. The manufacturing as well as
                    agricultural activities carried out in the Kerala capital are important for the economy of the
                    state. The Kerala Capital has a rail terminus, road facilities, an airport, and a harbour. It is
                    also an educational site with the University of Kerala and other large Institutions set up here.
                    Kerala is a beautiful state in India enriched with all kinds of eye-catching features and
                    magnetic destinations. Tourism in Kerala has been in place even before it was found and mapped.
                    Dutch, Portuguese, and Britishers had explored the state, but it still retains its natural
                    beauty with its distinguishing characteristics. Kerala tourism is increasing as people are
                    intrigued by the diversity in the state. One should take a tour to Kerala in a lifetime and know
                    what it is like to be the closest to nature.
